            <h4>User Stories</h4>
            <p>For this project, the main foundation of the project, where we first started, were targeting the base user
            stories such as:
            <ul>
            <li>Base User Story #1: As a user, I want to be able to view a presentation of the different
                aspects of my personal Spotify music listening tastes displayed in colorful and fun ways.
            </li>
            <li>Base User Story #2: As a user, I would like to be able to create and login to an account that
                saves my previously generated Spotify wraps.
            </li>
            <li>Base User Story #3: As a user, I would like the UI to be aesthetically-pleasing and responsive.</li>
            <li>Base User Story #4: As a developer, I would like to avoid security leaks by not hosting secrets
                like API keys on GitHub.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Working on these base user stories was the main focus of Sprint 1. With the base of the project laid out, we
            were then able to implement additional user stories like:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Duo-Wrapped</li>
            <li>Different Spotify Wrap durations</li>
            <li>Dark/Light Mode</li>
            <li>Running on a host service</li>
            <li>Transition animations</li>
            <li>Contact the developers</li>
            <li>Wireframe diagram on Figma</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            During sprints 2 and 3, we worked on the additional user stories, primarily focusing on Duo-Wrapped, running
            on a host service and transition animations.
            </p>
            <h4>Task Management</h4>
            <p>In order to organize and distribute tasks, our team utilized a kanban board on Notion.
                Additionally, in order to create clear communication between team members, we reported our
                current work status through daily standups and weekly scrum meetings.</p>
